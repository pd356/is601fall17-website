							         <p class="page-description"> My name is Passang Dolma and this is my first semester in the
								     MS Information Systems program. I am Tibetan however, I was born and raised in Nepal. To
								         read more about Tibet click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet">here</a> and to

									         I came to the United States in 2006 to pursue a college education, making me the
										 first person in my
										     family to attend a college. It was a difficult to adjust to the new culture at
										     first but eventually it
										         grew on me. However, the one thing that I couldn't stop thinking about
											 after moving here was the food -
											     our set meal.

												          The reason I decided to purse my Masters in Information
													  Systems was to enter the field of healthcare
													      technology. As a healthcare administrative
													      professional, I believe my knowledge of healthcare
													          administration and the knowledge I will gain in
														  the next couple of years at NJIT will help me
														  succed in
														      this field. It is a growing field and with
														      patient care and privacy depending more on
														      IST, it is a
														          field I am very much interested in.
